## Architecture

The app was initialised with create-react-app.

It retrives the data from a dedicated [JSON SERVER API](https://github.com/edisonabdiel/RomeoTaskDB) and displays it in cohesive manner.

Components were built in a fashion that allows for a more responsive, dynamic and scalable experience.

The UI is meant to be minimalistic yet engaging and intuitive. It was built using AntDesign to allow great control and autonomy over the layout of the app and also the design/feel of all the elements within it.

## Challenges

Bulding this app was a fun and challenging experience. Filtering based on the checkboxes values was tricky for which I ended up combining native hooks and handler functions.

## Further Improvements

- The filtering itself it could be improved as filter methods don't stack with eachother.
- Unit tests could be added to the app.
- Refactor it into TypeScript.

## API

Refer to the ```cosuno-server``` folder for more information on how to get the server running and how to use it.

```cd``` into the ```server``` folder and run the following command:
